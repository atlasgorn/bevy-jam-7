# Readme   
Important: these files were exported from Anytype, a free note taking app similar to Notion.   
It would make my life easier if you use it to make changes, because otherwise I'll have to sync them back and it's gonna get pretty messy pretty quickly.   
To join the workspace use this link: [https://invite.any.coop/bafybeibmpu6k45b63e4463aviagrupksgv27zrzeqzkv3qo6abdtdvkxdq#6kyAZQJDwEAbWzXjVbVk8Wsyzu3cS8XiUJTBfoRcQZzb](https://invite.any.coop/bafybeibmpu6k45b63e4463aviagrupksgv27zrzeqzkv3qo6abdtdvkxdq#6kyAZQJDwEAbWzXjVbVk8Wsyzu3cS8XiUJTBfoRcQZzb)    
   
Ensure that your very clever browser does not clear "trackers" from it, because it won't work (proven by George and his Brave browser).   
Alternatively you can copy and paste it into the app directly by pressing the "plus" button in the left sidebar and "Join by invite iink"   
   
## 1st way    
export just the object you modified and copy that. ("File > Export Object")   
If you modified nested object structure you can export the parent one and check "Include linked objects" - it will export all the children.   
## 2nd way    
export entire workspace using "File > Export Space" and copying the directory into the repo.   
## 3rd way    
ask me (@adsick) and I will do it   
   
Exported files will contain some metadata at the top of each file. You may strip it, it will likely break importing the workspace back to Anytype though.
